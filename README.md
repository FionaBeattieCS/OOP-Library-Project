# OOP-Library-Project

## Overview
This Java project, completed as part of my Year 1 coursework at Queen's University Belfast, serves as a prototype of a library management system. The goal was to create a functional system capable of managing data on library books and demonstrate key programming concepts.

## Project Details
**Project Name:** Assessment2
**Project Type:** Java Application

## Core Functionality (50 Marks Available)
The core functionality of this library management system includes the following:

### Object Classes
- **Book Class:** Represents attributes and methods of a book.
- **LibraryBook Class:** Extends the Book class and adds features specific to library books.
- **Library Class:** Manages and interacts with LibraryBook instances.

### Functionality Highlights
- Creation of LibraryBook instances with attributes like ID, status, image, and more.
- Library class with methods for borrowing, returning, listing, and managing books.
- Implementation of Lendable interface for tracking book lending operations.

## Text Console Application (Part 2)
The project includes a user-friendly text console application named QUBLibrary to interact with the library system. It provides menu-based options for users, including listing all books, adding and removing books, borrowing, returning, and displaying ranked book lists.

## Additional Features (Part 3)
A separate application, QUBLibraryUpdated, replicates the behavior of QUBLibrary from Part 1 while creatively making use of the Console class introduced in Practical 5. It enhances user input/output using a console for a seamless experience.

## Testing and Quality Assurance (20 Marks)
A rigorous testing procedure has been implemented, covering all core functionality areas of the Library class as outlined in Part 1 of the assignment specification. Detailed testing documentation is provided separately.

## Structure and Organization
- **Part01 Package:** Contains code related to core requirements.
- **Part02 Package:** Includes code for testing.
- **Part03 Package:** Incorporates code for the implementation of additional features.
